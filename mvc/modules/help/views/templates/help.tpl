<h3>Picks</h3>
All about picks.</br>
<ol>
	<li>You are able to make picks for the next weekend up until 18h00 on a
	Friday afternoon before the weekend's games begin. After that you will
	be given games from the round on the following week to select from. You
	will, in otherwords have missed the boat.</li>
	<li>You have the option of selecting random picks. Just click the
	button and rest assrured that the selection you get is random. No
	hacking here.</li>
	<li>At this stage there are no options for calling up your old picks. I
	am beavering away on this and will have it soon. You will know when its
	ready.</li>
	<li>When its a bonus week the picks selection box will display in RED
	the bonus week name. Ie: Double Score or Half Score...</li>
</ol>
<h3>Rankings, Points and the Leaderboard.</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Your points you score are as follows:
	<ul>
		<li>Win: 2 points</li>
		<li>Correct Margin: 5 points (this is 2 for the win plus 3 for the
		margin)</li>
		<li>Draw: 7 points (Draws are hard to pick so good luck)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>All points are calculated automatically. I have the maths right. Im
	sure of it. If you do however find a ... shall we say, "irregularity"
	... Please tell me as soon as you can. Its important. Dont worry
	though, your scores are not saved on the system. Only your picks are
	recorded. This means that when the game scores are added in by the
	games administrator, your points will be calculated based on the
	resulting margins as determined by the scores of each game.</li>
	<li>I hope that makes sense</li>
</ol>
<h3>Money</h3>
<ol>
	<li>You pay the box. Helen takes the money. Come monday morning after
	the scores have been entered in, Helen logs in and uses her admin menu
	options to find who the winners are and how much they are owed.</li>
	<li>Where does the money go?
	<ul>
		<li>Your stake money is halved each week. Half to pay out the weeks
		winners and wooden spoon. The other half is reserved for the end of
		the tournement to payout the overall winner and wooden spoon.</li>
		<li>Winners share stake. Its a Half, Third and left over kind of
		thing. $2.00 is reserved for the wooden spooners :) to share.</li>
		<li>Please keep the wooden spooning in the office to a minium.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
<h3>About this project</h3>
<ol>
	<li>This project consits of over 10 000 lines of code.</li>
	<li>The software is written in <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a>.  <em>PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. </em></li>
	<li>Your picks, games, and all settings are stored in a <a href="http://www.mysql.com/company">MySQL</a> database. <em>MySQL AB develops and markets a family of high performance, affordable database servers and tools. Our mission is to make superior data management available and affordable for all. We contribute to building the mission-critical, high-volume systems and products worldwide.</em></li>
	<li>This intranet website is hosted and run in house.  The webserver technology used in no way conflicts with the peddlethorp.co.nz website or our intranet.  The technology used is called Xampp (Lampp) but on windows.  To find out more about Xampp visit <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org">ApacheFriends.org</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Support</h3>
If you find its all running a bit slow its probably related to a number
of things beyond my control. BEYOND MY CONTROL. These include:
<ul>
	<li>A slow webserver machine. ITs a dinosaur but its a reliable one.</li>
	<li>Heavy traffic on our intranet network. Caused by people working.
	Nothing I can do about that.</li>
	<li>Lots of people trying to hack into the super14 sweepstakes admin
	area to change last weeks picks.</li>
</ul>
