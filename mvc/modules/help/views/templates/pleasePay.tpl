<h3>Cash</h3>
<p>The minimum stake to enter the competition is $2.00 per week.  This includes all picks for all games during the weekend on the week you have paid.</p>
<p>By paying your stake you not only contribute to the prize money you can potentially receive, but also to a fancy morning tea on the final day of prize giving to which all are invited.</p>
<p>So please pay your $2.00 stake.</p>
